# Intervention Project Data Preparation
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to clean and prepare the data of the Business Case Data Analysis for the Intervention and Project data set.

Once the data sets, read from an xlsx file, are cleaned and prepared, they are saved in a new xlsx file ready to be imported in Tableau for visualization.

The 2 created Tableau dashboards from those data sets are:
* [Intervention Project Occurrences](https://public.tableau.com/views/InterventionProjectOccurrences/InterventionFrequencyDashboard?:language=fr-FR&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
* [Intervention Success Scores](https://public.tableau.com/views/InterventionSuccessScores/InterventionSuccessScoresDashboard?:language=fr-FR&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
